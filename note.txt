THE INTERSECTION OBSERVER API
This API allows our code to basically observe changes to the way a certain targeted element intersect another element or the way it intersect the viewport.

To Use The Intersection Observer Api we need to start by creating a new intersection observer.

const obsCallback = function(entries, observer){
 //entries is an array of the threshold entries.
}
const obsOptions = {
    root: null, //it is the element that the target is intersecting
    threshold: 0.1, //this is the percentage of intersection that which the observer callback will be called
}
const observer = new IntersectionObserver(obsCallback, obsOptions)
observer.observe(section1)
